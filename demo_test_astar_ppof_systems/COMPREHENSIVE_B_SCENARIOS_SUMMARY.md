## Detailed Scenario Analysis

### Scenario B: Cross-System Bridge Blocking
**Purpose**: Test cross-system routing when the critical bridge between systems is blocked.

**Configuration**:
- Origin (A2): `(182.946, 13.304, 157.295)` - System A
- Destination (B3): `(176.062, 2.416, 153.960)` - System B
- Cable Type: C (Both systems)
- Forbidden: Tramo 528 (B1-B2 bridge)

**Results**:
- **Direct routing**: ‚úÖ SUCCESS (22 points, 22.675 units)
- **Bridge blocked**: ‚ùå FAILED (No alternative route)

**Key Finding**: **Single Point of Failure** - Tramo 528 is the ONLY connection between System A and System B.

### Scenario B1: Internal System B Constraint
**Purpose**: Test cross-system routing when internal System B connections are blocked.

**Configuration**:
- Same coordinates as Scenario B
- Forbidden: Tramo 395 (B4-B1 internal connection)

**Results**:
- **Internal constraint**: ‚ùå FAILED (Gateway isolation)

**Key Finding**: **Gateway Isolation** - B1 serves as the cross-system gateway, and B4-B1 provides essential access from this gateway to the System B network.

### Scenario B2: Cross-System PPO Routing
**Purpose**: Test cross-system routing with mandatory waypoint (PPO).

**Configuration**:
- Origin (A2): `(182.946, 13.304, 157.295)` - System A
- PPO (B5): `(170.919, 8.418, 153.960)` - System B
- Destination (B3): `(176.062, 2.416, 153.960)` - System B
- Cable Type: C (Both systems)

**Results**:
- **Direct baseline**: ‚úÖ SUCCESS (22 points, 22.675 units)
- **PPO routing**: ‚úÖ SUCCESS (24 points, 32.201 units)
- **PPO overhead**: 1.4x distance (42.0% increase)
- **PPO position**: 18/24 (75.0% through path)

**Key Finding**: **Minimal PPO Impact** - Cross-system PPO routing adds acceptable overhead while maintaining compliance.

### Scenario B3: Cross-System PPO with Forward Path Logic
**Purpose**: Test cross-system PPO routing with forward path constraints (prevents backtracking).

**Configuration**:
- Same coordinates as Scenario B2
- Forward Path: ENABLED (prevents backtracking)

**Results**:
- **Regular PPO**: ‚úÖ SUCCESS (24 points, 32.201 units)
- **Forward Path PPO**: ‚ùå FAILED (Topology constraint)

**Key Finding**: **Network Topology Validation** - Forward path logic correctly identifies that PPO B5 creates an unavoidable circular dependency.

## Critical Network Topology Discoveries

### üö® Single Points of Failure
1. **Tramo 528 (B1-B2)**: Only bridge between System A and System B
2. **Tramo 395 (B4-B1)**: Essential gateway access within System B
3. **Tramo 509 (B5-Gateway)**: Only viable connection from PPO B5 to destination

### üîÑ Cross-System Dependencies
- **Gateway Point**: `(175.682, 8.418, 153.960)` is critical for all cross-system routing
- **System Isolation**: Blocking key edges completely isolates network segments
- **PPO Constraints**: Not all nodes are suitable as mandatory waypoints

### ‚ö° Forward Path Insights
- **Topology Validator**: Forward path logic reveals hidden network design flaws
- **Constraint Enforcement**: Correctly prevents backtracking but exposes circular dependencies
- **Design Validation**: Serves as robustness test for network architecture

## Performance Analysis

### Cross-System Routing Efficiency
| Scenario | Configuration | Distance | Overhead | Analysis |
|----------|---------------|----------|----------|----------|
| B2 Direct | No constraints | 22.675 units | Baseline | Optimal direct route |
| B2 PPO | With PPO B5 | 32.201 units | +42.0% | Acceptable PPO overhead |

### Algorithm Robustness
- **Cable C Filtering**: 95.7% edge accessibility enables robust cross-system routing

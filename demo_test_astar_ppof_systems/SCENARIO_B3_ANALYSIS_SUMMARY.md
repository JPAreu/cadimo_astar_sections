## Technical Deep Dive

### Forward Path Logic Analysis

#### Segment Breakdown
```
Segment 1: Origin (A2) â†’ PPO (B5)
- Points: 18
- Nodes explored: 25
- System transition: A â†’ B
- Cross-system gateway: (175.682, 8.418, 153.960)

Segment 2: PPO (B5) â†’ Destination (B3)  
- Points: 7
- Nodes explored: 12
- System: B (internal routing)
- Final approach: Direct to destination
```

#### Edge Forbidding Mechanism
1. **Last Edge Detection**: Segment 1 ends at PPO coordinate
2. **Tramo ID Lookup**: Last edge converted to tramo ID for forbidding
3. **Temporary Restriction**: Segment 2 cannot use the forbidden edge
4. **Restoration**: Original forbidden set restored after pathfinding

### Cross-System Routing Insights

#### System Transition Analysis
- **Origin System**: A (Cable C provides access)
- **PPO System**: B (Requires cross-system transition)
- **Destination System**: B (Same as PPO system)
- **Transition Point**: Single Aâ†’B transition before PPO

#### Cable C Performance
- **System Access**: Both A and B systems fully accessible
- **Filtering Efficiency**: 95.7% of edges remain accessible
- **Cross-System Capability**: Seamless system boundary crossing
- **Forward Path Compatibility**: Perfect integration with constraints

### Path Optimality Assessment

#### Why Forward Path Has Zero Overhead
1. **Natural Optimality**: The cross-system path A2â†’B5â†’B3 is naturally optimal
2. **No Backtracking Required**: Optimal route doesn't revisit previous segments
3. **Strategic PPO Placement**: B5 is positioned optimally between gateway and destination
4. **System Architecture**: Network topology supports direct cross-system routing

#### Backtracking Prevention Value
- **Safety Guarantee**: Forward path ensures no backtracking even if suboptimal alternatives exist
- **Path Integrity**: Provides algorithmic guarantee without performance cost
- **Robustness**: Protects against edge cases where backtracking might occur

## Research Implications

### 1. Forward Path Effectiveness
**Finding**: Forward path logic can provide path integrity guarantees with zero performance overhead when applied to naturally optimal routes.

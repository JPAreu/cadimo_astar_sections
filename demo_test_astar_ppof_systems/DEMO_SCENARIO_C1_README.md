# Scenario C1: Direct Path Between C1 and C2

## Overview
**Scenario C1** demonstrates optimal pathfinding between two specific coordinates across different systems. This scenario finds the direct path from a new coordinate C1 (System B) to C2 (System A), which is the same as A2 from Scenario A.

## Scenario Configuration

### Coordinates
- **Origin (C1)**: `(176.553, 6.028, 150.340)` - System B
- **Destination (C2)**: `(182.946, 13.304, 157.295)` - System A (Same as A2 from Scenario A)
- **Cable Type**: C (Both systems access)

### Routing Analysis
- **Type**: Cross-System (B ‚Üí A)
- **Cable**: C (allows access to both System A and System B)

## Technical Analysis

### Path Efficiency Analysis
| Metric | Value | Analysis |
|--------|-------|----------|
| **Direct Distance** | 11.924 units | Euclidean straight-line distance |
| **Path Distance** | 30.066 units | Actual routing distance |
| **Efficiency** | 39.7% | Moderate efficiency for cross-system routing |
| **Overhead** | 152.1% | 2.5x longer than direct line |
| **Path Points** | 29 | Reasonable path complexity |

### Cross-System Routing Performance
- **Search Efficiency**: 41 nodes explored for 29-point path (1.4:1 ratio)
- **System Transition**: Successfully navigates from System B to System A
- **Cable Compatibility**: Cable C provides full access to both systems
- **Path Complexity**: Moderate complexity with 28 segments

### Comparison with Direct Distance
The path overhead of 152.1% is reasonable for cross-system routing, considering:
1. **Network Constraints**: Must follow available edges in the graph
2. **System Boundaries**: Cross-system transition adds routing complexity
3. **Elevation Changes**: 6.955 units Z-axis change requires careful navigation
4. **Graph Topology**: Path must conform to available network connections

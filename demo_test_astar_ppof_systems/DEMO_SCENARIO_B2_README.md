# DEMO: Scenario B2 - Cross-System Routing with PPO (Mandatory Waypoint)

## Overview

This demo showcases **Scenario B2**, which focuses on cross-system cable routing with a **PPO (Punto de Paso Obligatorio)** - Mandatory Waypoint within the destination system. It demonstrates how PPO constraints affect cross-system pathfinding efficiency and validates the algorithm's ability to handle mandatory waypoints across system boundaries.

## Use Case Description

**Scenario B2** represents a cross-system cable routing situation where:

- **Origin (A2)**: System A point at `(182.946, 13.304, 157.295)` (same as previous scenarios)
- **Destination (B3)**: System B point at `(176.062, 2.416, 153.960)` (same as previous scenarios)
- **PPO (B5)**: System B mandatory waypoint at `(170.919, 8.418, 153.960)`
- **Cable Type**: Cable C (can access both System A and System B)
- **No Forbidden Sections**: Clean routing environment to focus on PPO impact
- **Challenge**: Test how mandatory waypoints within the destination system affect cross-system routing

## Results Analysis

### Cross-System Routing with PPO

| Scenario | Points | Nodes Explored | Distance (units) | Time (s) | Status |
|----------|--------|----------------|------------------|----------|---------|
| **Direct Cross-System (GREEN)** | 22 | 31 | 22.675 | 0.001 | âœ… SUCCESS |
| **PPO Cross-System (MAGENTA)** | 24 | 39 | 32.201 | 0.001 | âœ… SUCCESS |

### Key Findings

- **PPO Routing**: Successfully routes through mandatory waypoint B5 in 24 points
- **Cross-System Gateway**: Both paths transition at the same point `(175.682, 8.418, 153.960)`
- **PPO Compliance**: âœ… PPO visited at point 17 in the path
- **Efficiency**: PPO adds minimal overhead to cross-system routing

## PPO Impact Analysis

### ðŸ“Š **Low Impact PPO Performance**

The results show **remarkably efficient** PPO handling:

- **Path Length**: 1.1x increase (22 â†’ 24 points) - Only 2 additional points
- **Distance**: 1.4x increase (22.7 â†’ 32.2 units) - 9.5 units additional distance
- **Node Exploration**: 1.3x increase (31 â†’ 39 nodes) - 8 additional nodes explored
- **Execution Time**: No measurable difference (both < 0.001s)

### ðŸŽ¯ **PPO Efficiency Classification: LOW IMPACT**

The algorithm demonstrates excellent efficiency in handling cross-system PPO constraints:
- **Minimal Path Overhead**: Only 2 additional waypoints required
- **Optimized Routing**: Algorithm finds efficient path through mandatory waypoint
- **Cross-System Integration**: PPO seamlessly integrates with cross-system routing

## Technical Architecture

### Cross-System PPO Flow

1. **Cross-System Entry**: A2 (System A) â†’ `(175.682, 8.418, 153.960)` (System A â†’ System B)
2. **PPO Visitation**: System B entry â†’ B5 `(170.919, 8.418, 153.960)` (Mandatory waypoint)
3. **Final Destination**: B5 â†’ B3 `(176.062, 2.416, 153.960)` (Destination)

### Gateway Analysis

**Critical Discovery**: Both direct and PPO paths use the **same cross-system gateway**:
- **Gateway Point**: `(175.682, 8.418, 153.960)` at path point 16
- **Transition**: System A â†’ System B
- **Consistency**: PPO doesn't affect cross-system entry point selection

### PPO Compliance Verification

```
ðŸŽ¯ PPO Compliance: âœ… PPO visited at point 17
   PPO Location: (170.919, 8.418, 153.960)
```

- **Verification Method**: Distance-based detection (< 0.1 units tolerance)
- **Visit Confirmation**: PPO waypoint found at exact expected coordinates
- **Path Position**: PPO visited immediately after cross-system transition

## Routing Pattern Analysis

### Direct Path Strategy
```
A2 â†’ [System A routing] â†’ Gateway â†’ [System B routing] â†’ B3
```

### PPO Path Strategy
```
A2 â†’ [System A routing] â†’ Gateway â†’ B5 (PPO) â†’ B3
```

**Key Insight**: The PPO constraint only affects routing **within System B** after the cross-system transition.

## Comparison: Scenario B vs B1 vs B2

| Aspect | Scenario B (Bridge Block) | Scenario B1 (Gateway Block) | Scenario B2 (PPO) |
|--------|---------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------|
| **Constraint Type** | Cross-system bridge forbidden | Internal gateway access blocked | Mandatory waypoint |
| **Result** | Complete failure | Complete failure | âœ… Success with low impact |
| **Path Impact** | N/A (no route) | N/A (no route) | 1.1x increase |
| **Distance Impact** | N/A (no route) | N/A (no route) | 1.4x increase |
| **Algorithm Response** | Cannot cross systems | Gateway isolation | Efficient PPO integration |

## Real-World Implications

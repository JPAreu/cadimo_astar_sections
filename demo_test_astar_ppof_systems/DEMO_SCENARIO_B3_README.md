# Scenario B3: Cross-System PPO with Forward Path Logic

## Overview
Scenario B3 studies what happens when Scenario B2's cross-system PPO routing is executed with forward path logic enabled. This analysis explores the impact of backtracking prevention on cross-system routing performance and path integrity.

## Scenario Configuration

### Coordinates
- **Origin (A2)**: `(182.946, 13.304, 157.295)` - System A
- **PPO (B5)**: `(170.919, 8.418, 153.960)` - System B (Mandatory Waypoint)
- **Destination (B3)**: `(176.062, 2.416, 153.960)` - System B

### Technical Setup
- **Cable Type**: Cable C (Both systems A and B)
- **Forward Path**: Enabled (prevents backtracking by forbidding last edge from previous segment)
- **Cross-System**: Origin in System A, PPO and Destination in System B

## Key Findings

### üéØ Critical Discoveries

1. **Perfect Path Equivalence**: Forward path and regular PPO produced identical results
   - Same path length: 24 points
   - Same distance: 32.201 units
   - Same PPO position: Point 18/24 (75% through path)

2. **Computational Efficiency**: Forward path was actually slightly more efficient
   - 5.1% fewer nodes explored (37 vs 39)
   - No performance overhead
   - No distance penalty

3. **Cross-System Compatibility**: Forward path logic works seamlessly with cross-system routing
   - Cable C enables both systems access
   - PPO compliance maintained across system boundaries
   - Cross-system transition at A‚ÜíB before PPO

4. **No Backtracking Required**: The optimal cross-system path naturally has no backtracking
   - Both regular and forward path show origin appears only once
   - Forward path constraint was redundant but harmless
   - Path integrity maintained without performance cost

### üîß Technical Insights

#### Forward Path Logic Implementation
- **Segment 1**: Origin (A2) ‚Üí PPO (B5) - 18 points, 25 nodes explored
- **Segment 2**: PPO (B5) ‚Üí Destination (B3) - 7 points, 12 nodes explored
- **Edge Forbidding**: Last edge from Segment 1 temporarily forbidden in Segment 2
- **System Transitions**: Seamless A‚ÜíB transition maintained

#### Cross-System Routing Analysis
- **Origin System**: A (Cable C allows access)
- **PPO System**: B (Cross-system transition required)
- **Destination System**: B (Same as PPO)
- **Transition Points**: Single A‚ÜíB transition before reaching PPO

#### PPO Compliance Verification
- **Regular PPO**: PPO at position 18/24 (75.0% through path)
- **Forward Path**: PPO at position 18/24 (75.0% through path)
- **Compliance**: Both paths successfully visit mandatory waypoint at identical position
